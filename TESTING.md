This is our testing documentation for the EmailGPT Chrome extension
# Interface Testing
Our application consists of three components: ApiKeyForm, MainScreen and History feature. To ensure that each of these features renders appropriately when run, and to handle any edge cases, we created testing files for each of the features that use jest and react for automated testing to mock client inputs.

Test files are located alongside their respective components:

- `src/components/ApiKeyForm.test.tsx` - Tests for the API Key form
- `src/components/MainScreen.test.tsx` - Tests for the main interface
- `src/components/History.test.tsx` - Tests for the History feature 

These tests can be run with the 'npm test' command.
