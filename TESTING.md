This is our testing documentation for the EmailGPT Chrome extension
# Interface Testing
Our application consists of three components: ApiKeyForm, MainScreen and History feature. To ensure that each of these features renders appropriately when run, and to handle any edge cases, we created testing files for each of the features that use jest and react for automated testing to mock client inputs.

Test files are located alongside their respective components:

- `src/components/ApiKeyForm.test.tsx` - Tests for the API Key form
- `src/components/MainScreen.test.tsx` - Tests for the main interface
- `src/components/History.test.tsx` - Tests for the History feature 

These tests can be run with the 'npm test' command.

**Evaluation**
The model performed better than expected. It was able to recognize action items that had already been resolved and only listed those that needed to be pursued following the email conversation, and outlined an implicit deadline. The model includes the sender email within the message by message breakdown as well, which also makes it more convenient in analysis. However, it did provide the summary in a bullet format instead of a paragraph so that was a bit different from our desired outcome.
