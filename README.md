# Team Collaboration Workflow
Work on separate branches
- every time you finish working
     1. git fetch origin # so you're on latest remote version
     2. git status # optional, to check whether you're on the right branch, what changes you've made that's different from local
     3. git pull origin main # try to complete merge requests yourself
     5. git add .
     6. git commit -m "whatever you did" 
     7. git push origin [your current branch]
- make a pull request, add luna as a reviewer
- try not to push directly to main if possible
